# privacy

The privacy of a group correspond to the way in which non-members of the group are allowed to interract with it.

- public: the group can appear in search results, and in top/new/popular listings
- private: the group can only be accessed by invitation

 Upon creating a group, the creator specifies its privacy status. It may later be changed.
